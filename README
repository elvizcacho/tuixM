This library adds some extra functions to use with vectors and matrixes.

new functions in Array prototype:

Array.init(length,initNum); --> Initializes a vector and sets initNum on each cell.
Array.initM(fil,col,initNum); --> Initializes a matrix and sets initNum on each cell

Array.copy(matrix); --> copies matrix to this array.
Array.writeM(); --> writes the matrix on the document.
Array.transM(); --> replaces the matrix with the transposed version of itself.
Array.toEach(f); --> applies f to each matrix cell.
Array.fbM(f,matrix) --> applies f between this Array cells and matrix cells.
Array.sumM(matrix) --> matrix addition between this Array and matrix parameter.
Array.sumM(matrix) --> matrix multiplication between this Array and matrix parameter.
