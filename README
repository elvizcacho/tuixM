This library adds some extra functions to use with vectors and matrixes.

new functions in Array prototype:

Array.init(length,initNum); --> Initializes a vector and sets initNum on each cell.
Array.initM(fil,col,initNum); --> Initializes a matrix and sets initNum on each cell

Array.copy(matrix); --> copy matrix to this array.
Array.writeM(); --> write the matrix on the document.
Array.transM(); --> replaces the matrix with the transposed version of itself.

comming soon:

Matrix and vector operations =)
